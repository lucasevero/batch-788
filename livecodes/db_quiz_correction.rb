# Q16 - Define each Active Record model with its associations for your database.
# Hint: We‚Äôre working with 4 tables: authors, books, users & readings. Therefore we need 4 models!

class Author
  has_many :books
end

class Book
  belongs_to :author
  has_many :readings
  has_many :users, through: :readings
end

class User
  has_many :readings
  has_many :books, through: :readings
end

class Reading
  belongs_to :book
  belongs_to :user
end

# Q17 - Complete the following code using the relevant Active Record methods.

#1. Add your favorite author to the DB
ariano = Author.new(name: "Ariano Suassuna")
ariano.save

Author.create(name: "Ariano Suassuna")

#2. Get all authors
Author.all # => [author1, author2, ...]

#3. Get author with id=8
Author.find(8) # => instance of Author

#4. Get author with name="Jules Verne", store it in a variable: jules
jules = Author.find_by(name: 'Jules Verne')

#5. Get Jules Verne's books
jules.books

#6. Create a new book "20000 Leagues under the Seas". Store it in a variable: twenty_thousand
twenty_thousand = Book.new(title: "20000 Leagues under the Seas", publishing_year: 1870, category: "Fiction")

#7. Add Jules Verne as this book's author
twenty_thousand.author = jules

#8. Now save this book in the DB!
twenty_thousand.save


# Q18 - Add validations of your choice to the Author class.

class Author
  validates :name, presence: true, uniqueness: true
end
